 * Vertical Grid System
 * --------------------
 *
 * We try to adhere to a baseline grid, which is a vertical grid with lines
 * every X pixels. The baseline of text should always fall on this line.

/**
 * Horizontal Grid System
 * ----------------------
 *
 * This grid system is responsive in four sizes, where all sizes use a 12 column
 * grid.
 *
 * Since the values are calculated, you need to compile the Less code to see the
 * values. From glue, run `node tools/output-grid-values.js` to see
 * the values.
 *
 * Here's a reference for what to use the variables for:
 *
 * Min Width (including scroll bar)
 * --------------------------------
 * Including scroll bar:  $glue-screen-min
 * Excluding scroll bar:  $glue-body-width-min
 *
 * Max Width (of content, space on the sides)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Including scroll bar:  $glue-screen-max
 * Excluding scroll bar:  $glue-body-width-max
 *
 * Page Gutter (gutter on the sides of the page)
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Size:                  $glue-grid-page-gutter
 *
 * Extra Small (xs)
 * ----------------
 * Gutter size:           $glue-grid-column-gutter-xs
 * View width range:      $glue-screen-min to $glue-screen-xs-max
 *
 * Small (sm)
 * ----------
 * Gutter size:           $glue-grid-column-gutter-sm
 * View width range:      $glue-screen-sm-min to $glue-screen-sm-max
 *
 * Medium (md)
 * -----------
 * Gutter size:           $glue-grid-column-gutter-md
 * View width range:      $glue-screen-md-min to $glue-screen-md-max
 *
 * Large (lg)
 * ----------
