/**
 * Horizontal Grid System
 * ----------------------
 *
 * This grid system is responsive in four sizes, where all sizes use a 12 column
 * grid.
 *
 * Since the values are calculated, you need to compile the Less code to see the
 * values. From glue, run `node tools/output-grid-values.js` to see
 * the values.
 *

 *
 * Min Width (including scroll bar)
